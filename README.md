## coloring algorithm using Welsh Powell 

we want to organize the tasks of the realization of an order of the pastry products of a wedding party. This order contains complex products that will be made by a group of staff and others require only one or two pastry chefs.

The company is studying the minimization of the period of realization of this order to have the opportunity to offer the customers the good service and to minimize the delay time. And to do it I chose to study the case of a standard command, which contains the following elements:
* Wedding-Cake : on suppose que c’est un gâteau qui contient 4 étage.  
* Maccaron : 15 Kg. 
* Moroccan cakes : about 30 Kg. 
* The prestige cakes: about 30 Kg.
* Ice cakes: 20 pieces.
* Pastilla seafood: 20 tables
* The juice (mixed): 30 liters.
* The bread: 200 pieces.

Each product requires a period of time for its manufacture:
* Wedding cake: 30 hours 
* Maccaron: 16 hours 
* Moroccan cakes: 16 hours 
* The prestige cakes: 12 hours 
* Ice cakes: 16 hours 
* Pastilla seafood: 8 hours 
* The juice (mixed):  8 hours 
* The bread: 8 hours 

PS: The working time of confectioners in a day is 8 hours.

the need of each product of the material:
* Wedding cake: 1,2,3 
* Maccaron: 1,2 
* Moroccan cakes: 1,2,4 
* The prestige cakes: 1,2 
* Ice cakes: 3,5 
* Pastilla seafood: 1 
* The juice (mixed): 2,5 
* The bread: 1,4

## Algorithm Dijkstra 

A shorter path problem is an algorithmic problem of graph theory. The goal is to calculate a path between vertices of a graph that minimizes or maximizes a certain function.

There are many variations of this problem. Suppose we give a finite graph, oriented or not according to the case; in addition, each arc or edge has a value that can be a weight or a length. A shortest path between two given nodes is a path that minimizes the sum of the values of the traversed arcs. To compute a shorter path, there are many algorithms, depending on the nature of the values and any additional constraints. In many cases, there are complexity algorithms in polynomial time, such as the Dijkstra algorithm in positive weight graphs

algorithm : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithme_de_Dijkstra
l'algorithme de Dijkstra (prononcé [dɛɪkstra]) sert à résoudre le problème du plus court chemin. Il permet, par exemple, de déterminer un plus court chemin pour se rendre d'une ville à une autre connaissant le réseau routier d'une région. Plus précisément, il calcule des plus courts chemins à partir d'une source dans un graphe orienté pondéré par des réels positifs. On peut aussi l'utiliser pour calculer un plus court chemin entre un sommet de départ et un sommet d'arrivée.

## Simplex algorithm Branch and Bround 

The Branch and Bound method is one of the important methods in linear programming, it solves complex problems in real life like the problem of sacking: "Soon the holidays ... How to fill my bag as best as possible? "

algorithm : 
* Branch-and-bound methods are methods based on an "intelligent" enumeration of the permissible solutions of a combinatorial optimization problem. 
* Idea: to prove the optimality of a solution by partitioning the space of the solutions. 
* "Divide and conquer" 
* Application to integer linear programming: uses all the power of linear programming to determine good bounds. 
* The linear program obtained by removing the integrality constraints on the variables is called linear relaxation of a linear program in integers.
